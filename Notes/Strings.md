Strings are a Type of data.

# Format Strings
If we want to evaluate inside of a string, we use *f-strings*.
To create an f-string, we put an `f` before the open quote.

```python
fav_food = input("what's your favorite food? ")

print(f"Oooooo, {fav_food} sounds good!")
```


# String Methods
[[Methods]] are functions that we can use on [[objects]].

String methods allow us to modify strings.

Say for example, we want to make all the characters of a string lowercase.

```python
mr_ubial_yelling = "YOU SHOULD PUSH YOUR CHAIRS IN"

print(mr_ubial_yelling.lower())
```

The `.lower()` method takes a string and converts all uppercase characters to lowercase.
