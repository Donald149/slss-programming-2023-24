# Food Suggestion Bot
# Author: Donald
# 6 October 2023

# A bot that asks the user what their favorite food is.
# Based on that food, it will classify the type/genre/cuisine of the food
# It will then give a restaurant suggestion.

# Introduce bot to user
# Ask the user what their favorite food is

# Add another cuisine that our bot should make a suggestion for
japanese_food = ["sushi", "sashimi", "udon", "tempura"]

# If they answer with Italian food, 
# Suggest an Italian restaurant.
# If they answer with Japanese food,
# Suggest a Japanese restaurant.
# If it's neither of the options above,
# Apologise for not being a competent bot.
